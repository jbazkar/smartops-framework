# Contributing

Thanks for considering a contribution! This repository is **illustrative**—keep changes sanitized (no secrets, no vendor IP).

## Process
1. Fork and create a feature branch.
2. Make changes in `smartops/*` with type hints and docstrings.
3. Add tests in `tests/`.
4. Run the example locally.
5. Open a PR describing your change and how it remains sanitized.

## Style
- Python 3.10+
- Small functions, clear names, docstrings
- No credentials; use env vars or placeholders
